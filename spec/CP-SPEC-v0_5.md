**Extensions define:** the `role` vocabulary — `api-designer`, `compliance-checker`, `reviewer`, `deployer` — and what each role is permitted to produce.

**Why Tier 2:** every agentic deployment produces these, and the record of *which model, in which role, produced what* is load-bearing for retrospective evaluation; but what the roles are is a domain matter. The first operational run of CP (§27) produced thirteen of these without the specification naming them. This version names them.

### 5.8 Constraint **[NEW — D-028, D-029]** and its relation to ConstraintDecl

Two things in prior versions and in operational use shared the name "constraint." This version separates them.

**ConstraintDecl** (§20.3) is a *declared normative frame* — the standard an entity adheres to. DAX is a ConstraintDecl. It is Tier 1: forkable (`fork_of`), lineage-bearing, the thing AdherenceClaims are made against.

| Rotation log | Append-only key event log with pre-rotation | Grows | The entity, via anchor |
| Verification methods | Anchor (SLH-DSA), workhorse (ML-DSA-44), transitional (Ed25519), federated providers | Via log | The entity |
| Services | Resolution paths, friendly names, provider endpoints | Via log | The entity |
| Custody | Permanent content-addressed substrate + any mirrors | Permanent | No one — multi-local |
| Publishing | Writing genesis and log to custody | — | Operator (default) or entity (always open) |
| Friendly name | Human-readable alias, cryptographically verified | Mutable | Registry (convenience only) |

The fingerprint is the frozen root. Everything else evolves around it. No layer gives any operator the power to be a required custodian.

- Adjudicators' `engagement_score`s accumulate. A principal whose Contestations are consistently scored unengaged has a record.
- Contestations are themselves contestable. A pattern of bad-faith contestation can be contested as a pattern.

Volume is not filtered. It is made legible, so that whoever looks later can see it for what it was.

### 12.6 Adjudication

An Adjudication resolves a Contestation. It is a `cp.adjudication.v1` referrer on the Contestation.
